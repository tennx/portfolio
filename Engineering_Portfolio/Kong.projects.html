				This was a one month long project where we noth had to use drag and drop coding to create a game.  We brainstormed together to make a platformer that including real gaming features like gravity and 
				lives. Overall, it was a fun introduction project for what the rest of the class would be like. </li>

				At first we had a lot of issues until our teacher came to help us.  The project was fun and other users didn't have many critiques regarding how the game ran.  In the code, Halim and I added a lot of comments and a few docstrings since there was
				no requirement on creating a project log.</li>

				<li style="color: black"> SUMMARY:  I was assigned to work in a group of four with Will Lavanakul, Franklin Fitzpatrick, and Ian Yeung.  
				We wre given three weeks to design a vehicle that could hold a power source to travel one meter in the fastest time.  During the project, we first encountered a very fast prototype with our solar cell.  Soon it stopped working
				and we had to come in during lunch to troubleshoot issues.  Our primary idea was to use three wheels and place our motor in the middle and connect that to a chain and sprocket system to power our back wheels.  We 
				made many prorotypes since the many first didn't work.  Although we didn't have the fastest vehicle in the class, we had learned a lot.  We learned how to breadboard wires to make a working circuit, organize a document, and practice 
				using Ohm's law.  The project was very fun because  there were little restrictions and I would've enjoyed more time to work on this project.

				</b>
				<li style="color: black"> SUMMARY:  For this project, our group, Shelja, Ashley and myself were assigned to create a machine that would transport cookies to one location and then to the next.  Initially, we were behind on this 
				project since we were catching up from the previous one, so that required us to come in during lunch to work on it.  To start the project, each member of our group created one design of a machine that we had in mind and compare it with 
				each others' design.  To narrow down our choice to one machine, we used a design matrix that would judge the ideas based on what our constraints were.  For example, we were only allowed to use a certain number of sensors/motors so we had to take into
				account how much each machine required in order to work.  We found that the best idea was Ashley's and began building that.  Ashley had completed most of the program for the cookie transportation machine so Shelja and I had little to do but revise it.
				Instead, the three of us focused on building the machine and came across one problem.  A type of transportation gave us issues when we tried testing our machine so we had to make a quick revision (the rack and pinion system in the photo to the right) to the machine so that it would work.  Other than 
				this edit, the machine functioned properly and was a success.
