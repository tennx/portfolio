		Hello my name is Mark Kong from Dublin High School.  I created this portfolio in my freshman year to create a portfolio of all projects and achievements in my high school experience.  My first engineering class was in 8th grade and I loved that so I wanted to explore more in high school.  During my time here I found interest in the computer science and was placed on that pathway on Dublin High School’s engineering academy.  My grades are high, making honor roll every quarter and semester, my grade point average never dropping below a 3.8.  My intention for this was to widen my perspective about all the types of engineering occupations in the United States.  This path is helping me to learn about computer science to prepare for this job and major in my future.  I took interest in working with others to build something, almost anything.  Then I was curious about coding and how to do it so I tried it and loved it.  The working environment seems fun and exciting since there are always new tasks to work on, leading me to become a software engineer.

		</p>
		<p> I consider my greatest strength to be my perseverance and my weakness to be my laziness.  Usually I find myself trying new things with other people and taking risks.  Other times, these new things require perseverance since they are hard skills to learn.  These challenges really make me try all the solutions I can think of before I ask another person and really apply this thought to studying and my extracurricular life.  For example, I swam for my high school since my freshmen year in high school and feared practice everyday.  Thankfully, I found how to push myself further than I thought was possible and was really happy with my results.  The experience taught me to be strong in times of many discouraging times even when I knew I was going to lose.  Additionally the same applies to my favorite sport, archery, where we must fully learn a concept before moving onto the next, otherwise the we won’t be able to be consistent.  I’ve trained many different ways in both sports pushing past my physical limitations and mental limitations I’ve set for myself by branching out to try new things and have grown a lot due to that.
</p>
<p> During my free time I spend it, swimming, shooting arrows, or participating in a boy scout events.  From these I have many awards to summarize my involvements in each club.  Starting with Boys scouts, I have been involved since 2013.  I currently am a life scout who has gone to the National Youth Leadership Training program who has applied to this knowledge to my leadership roles in my troop before and after the training.  In swim, I received the most dedicated swimmer in the summer of 2015 leading to my acceptance to the Junior Varsity team at Dublin High.  I’ve been swimming while in Boy Scouts and have taken up archery a year and a half after I started swimming in the summer of 2014.  I practice almost daily, only taking a break one day a week to train to make the United States Archery Team.  Currently I am ranked 5th in the state of California for the cadet recurve division and apart of the Regional Dream Team West of 30 members.
</p>

<p> In short, I see myself as an adventurous learner who will always keep growing.  If you are interested in meeting me please cheek under the “contact” tab to find your preferred way to talk to me.  Thank you for reading a bit about me and thank your for your time.  If you have any extra time please check out other parts of my site to learn more about me.
